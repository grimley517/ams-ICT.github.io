        <p>In this unit we will be exploring the difference between real and fractional numbers.  This is an ICT unit we will be focussing on the Algorithms and procedures involved, as opposed to the general mathematics.  The optional tasks at the end will focus ofn programming a computer to be able to perform mathematical tasks using the python programming language.</p>

<h1>Aims</h1>

<p>This is an introduction to your unit.</p>
<p> This unit addresses the algorithmic (alg) and programming (P&D) sections of the national Curriculum.  For the year 2015 non-GCSE computing students will not necessarily have the backgrouond in Computing required to perform the Programing and development secetions.  These components are addressed in the optional tasks for higher achievers, and GCSE computing students. </p>
<p>By the end of this unit you will learn:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>Level 5</li>
  <ul>
  <li>(Alg) Recognises that different algorithms exist for the same problem. </li>

<li>(Alg) Represents solutions using a structured notation.</li> 
<li>(Alg) Can identify similarities and differences in situations and can use these to solve problems (pattern recognition).</li>
<li>(P&D)Understands that programming bridges the gap between algorithmic solutions and computers.</li>
<li>(P&D) Has practical experience of a high-level textual programming language.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>Level 6</li>
  <ul>
    <li>(alg) Understands a recursive solution to a problem repeatedly applies the same solution to smaller instances of the problem.</li>
    <li>(alg)Recognises that some problems share the same characteristics and use the same algorithm to solve both (generalisation). </li>
    <li>(alg) Understands the notion of performance for algorithms and appreciates that some algorithms have different performance characteristics for the same task.</li>
    <li>(P&D) Uses nested selection statements. </li>

    <li>(P&D) Appreciates the need for, and writes, custom functions including use of parameters. </li>

    <li>(P&D) Knows the difference between, and uses appropriately, procedures and functions.</li>
    <li>(P&D) Understands and uses negation with operators.</li>
    <li>(P&D) Uses and manipulates one dimensional data structures. </li>
    <li>(P&D) Detects and corrects syntactical errors.</li>

<p>Algorithmic Exercise</p>

<h2>Learning aims:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>To be able to use a flow chart which formally describes an algorithm.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Task 1</h2>
<img width = 95% src="images/algorithm1.png" alt="Flow chart1"/>

<p>An algorithm describes a process. </p>
<p>Lets examine the algorithm and think about its parts</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>What shape is used to denote the start and end of the process</li>
    <li>What shape is used to denote data being input or output?</li>
    <li>What shape is used to denote a process?</li>
    <li>What shape is used to denote a decision (a question)?</li>
    <li>When a question is asked how many possible answers should there be?</li>
</ol>
<p>In a flow chart shapes have meaning and are important</p>
<h2>Task 2 - Testing an algorithm</h2>
<p>When we test an algorithm we should start by drawing a table with one column for each of the variables.  A variable is a store for an item.  In this algorithm there are three variables - Numerator, denominator and variable 1.</p>
<pre>Insert variables and testing video.</pre>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>What are the inputs to the process mapped out in the algorithm described?</li>
    <li>What are the outputs from the algorithm described</li>
    <li>Sum up in your own words - what does the algorithm do?</li>
    <li>Make a testing table to show how the algorithm works with the following inputs</li>
    <table border='hairline'>
        <tr>
            <th>Numerator</th>
            <th>Demoninator</th>
    
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>12</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
